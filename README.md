# enum4linux-0.9
This unofficial version adds the option '-L' to log user lists in a format readable by tools such as Nmap or Metasploit. The option '-a' will also activate this new option.

The option '-L' will generate txt files with the naming scheme '$ip-$group-users.txt' for each group in the domain. Entries are separated by a new line:

DOMAIN\username1
DOMAIN\username2
DOMAIN\username3
